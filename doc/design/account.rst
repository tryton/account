Account
=======

In Tryton the *Account* concept is used to represent the different accounts
that make up the `Company's <company:model-company.company>` chart of accounts.
These accounts are commonly organised into a structure, with each account
having a single parent and zero or more sub accounts.

The balance of an account is made up from all the credits and debits into
the account and its sub accounts.
These values are in the company's
`Currency <currency:model-currency.currency>`, but a second currency can be
used on accounts that record transactions that happen in a different currency.

Each account has an `Account Type <model-account.account.type>` which
defines some additional properties of the account.
A second type can be specified for accounts whose type depends on whether they
have a credit or debit balance.

Only accounts that are not closed can be used as a source or destination for
`Account Moves <model-account.move>`.

Tryton will only try and reconcile
`Account Move Lines <model-account.move.line>` in accounts that are correctly
marked when `Reconciling <wizard-account.reconcile>` accounts.

In Tryton a *deferral* account is any account that appears on a company's
balance sheet, or is not shown on any reports.
The amounts in these accounts are carried forward to subsequent
`Fiscal Years <model-account.fiscalyear>`, and are stored using the
`Account Deferral <model-account.account.deferral>` concept.

.. _model-account.account.type:

Account Type
============

The *Account Type* concept defines the structure of the
`Company's <company:model-company.company>` accounting reports.
It defines whether the account type appears on the balance sheet or income
statement, and has a set of properties that indicate what any
`Accounts <model-account.account>` of this type can be used for.

When used as the balance sheet or income statement the amount shown for the
account type includes the amounts from all the accounts of that type and
includes the amounts from all of its children.

The amounts from accounts that also have a debit type are only ever included
in either the account's type, or its debit type, depending on whether the
accounts balance is in credit, or debit, respectively.

   The list of account types can be found by opening the main menu item:

`Party <party:model-party.party>`, groups the payment amounts into the
appropriate term based on the maturity date from the payment's
`Account Move Line <model-account.move.line>`.
A payment amount appears in the first term it is equal to or more overdue than.
